  Hey, I'm Karl 👋

  Entrepreneur. Developer. Tech enthusiast. And proud father.

  For over 12 years, I've been building digital products that matter – from webshops and web apps to native apps and games.
  I love turning ideas into real-world impact, whether in fast-moving startups or with established clients.

  I'm the founder & CEO of CodeLax 🍻🚀
  We challenge the status quo with clean code, smart design, and a no-bullshit mindset.

  🐦 Side project: https://cardpecker.bot – free WhatsApp bot for Trading Card Games. Card lookups, real-time prices, rules – no app needed. Love TCGs and wanted to support players and stores out there using WhatsApp.
