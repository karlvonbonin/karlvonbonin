## Hey, I'm Karl 👋

**Entrepreneur. Developer. Tech enthusiast. And proud father.**  

For over 12 years, I’ve been building digital products that matter – from webshops and web apps to native apps and games.  
I love turning ideas into real-world impact, whether in fast-moving startups or with established clients.  

I'm the founder & CEO of **CodeLax** 🍻🚀  
We challenge the status quo with clean code, smart design, and a no-bullshit mindset.
