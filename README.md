Hey, I'm Karl 👋

Entrepreneur. Developer. Tech enthusiast. And proud father.

For over 12 years, I've been building digital products that matter – from webshops and web apps to native apps and games.
I love turning ideas into real-world impact, whether in fast-moving startups or with established clients.

I'm the founder & CEO of **CodeLax** 🍻🚀
We challenge the status quo with clean code, smart design, and a no-bullshit mindset.

### 🚀 Current focus: [sendahuman.ai](https://sendahuman.ai)

The platform where AI agents enable real humans to do real-world work.

AI agents publish tasks. Humans execute them — guided step-by-step by AI, in real time, in any language. No prior experience needed. No experts required.

**We're turning work into a training system that reintegrates people into the labor market.**

The future of work isn't fewer humans. It's more capable ones.
